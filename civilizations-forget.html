      <h1>Civlizations Forget</h1>
      <p>
        I recently came across
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk"
          >Jonathan Blow - Preventing the Collapse of Civilization
        </a>
        and it was an eye-opening talk. It is a must watch, especially if you're
        working in anything that touches engineering.
      </p>
      <!--

          Film Photography, no one to repair camera, equipment that produces
          film. We can't replicate that. Leica cameras film dwindling quality.
        </li>
      </ul>
      -->
      <p>
        The talk goes over how knowledge can be lost over time, especially the
        ones about the nuances and tradeoffs that gradually leads to the
        degradation of technology. It was eye opening, and you start to notice
        this pattern going all around you.

          The default of any system is decay. Without significant effort working
          against it, enough time and any system would crumble. This is
          especially true for knowledge.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          This is why technology degrades. It takes a lot of energy to
          communicate from generation to generation, there are losses.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Knowledge is memory with nuance. It is built up over time and it's
          really hard to communicate and pass on. Take the example of Film
          Cameras. Those mechanical and Electrical cameras your parents used to
          take pictures in ? that got replaced with the digital era. Well they
          are having a comeback. But the problem is there are a lot of old
          mechanical cameras
