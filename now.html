      <p>
        This is my now page, inspired by
        <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Siver's Now page</a>. It lists out
        what I'm currently working on and why.

      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>
        Currently I'm working on something secret. It's related to payments and
        India. I have a clear idea about what the end product is going to be,
        but it's so early I don't know how we're going to get there.
