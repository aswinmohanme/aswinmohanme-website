      <h1>A Road to Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView</h1>
      <p>
        A blog post on how to learn Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView and how to be
        productive in it as fast as possible. Partially inspired by Road to
        Common Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have lately been getting questions on how to learn Elixir and Phoenix
        and even though I do not know the best way forward, I am sharing the
        path which I went on in the hopes that it might help someone. This guide
        is written in mind an engineer with preferable experience in another
        programming language, who wants to pickup Elixir and get productive
        fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though I will try my best to keep this guide updated, the Elixir
        ecosystem is exploding in content. Even though the language and the
        framework rarely has foundational level changes, there will always be
        new resources to go through. If you find any sort of issues with the
        guide, report to

        <h2>Why Learn Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView</h2>
        <p>
          Although you have your reasons to learn Elixir, I'll reiterate them
          over here.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          If you are going to learn Elixir, you should know a tab bit of history
          behind it, so you can understand why certain things are the way they
          are, and how initially it might stump you, but Elixir has good reason
          for that.

        <h2>Learning Elixir</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to learn just enough Elixir to get to Phoenix and LiveView
          and start building web apps.
        </p>
        <h3>Basics</h3>
        <p>
          Elixir has one of the best pieces of official documentation and
          getting started guide. Finish first seciont of
          <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html"
            >Elixir Getting Started Guide</a
          >
          and if you are strapped for time until the Processes section. This
          should give you a basic understanding of the language and the syntax.
