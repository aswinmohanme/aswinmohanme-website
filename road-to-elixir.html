      <h1>A Road to Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView</h1>
      <p>
        A blog post on how to learn Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView and how to be
        productive in it as fast as possible. Partially inspired by
        <a href="https://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/"
          >A Road to Common Lisp</a
        >.

        I have lately been getting questions on how to learn Elixir and Phoenix
        and even though I do not know the best way forward, I am sharing the
        path which I went on in the hopes that it might help someone.

        Even though I will try my best to keep this guide updated, the Elixir
        ecosystem is exploding in content. Even though the language and the
        framework rarely has foundational level changes, there will always be
        new resources to go through. If you find any sort of issues with the
        guide, report to <a href=""></a>
