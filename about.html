        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Hey, I'm Aswin Mohan. I'm a Software Developer currently based out of
          Kerala, India. I love to design, code and make bold, beautiful, useful
          things. I love film photography, old typewriters and completely
          mechanical things with zero trace of electronics on the side.

        <h2>What is this blog?</h2>
        <p>
          This blog is my corner on the Internet. I love to write, to share my
          thoughts with the world, to have great conversations with people and
          enjoy life. I'm forever grateful for the Internet to give me a
          seamless way to do that. Here I share my thoughts, my learnings and
          anything else I think about writing. This blog doesn't have any other
          goals than being a public record of my thoughts, so expect it to have
          a similar personality to mine. So if you like what I write, share your
          thoughts with me at
          <a href="mailto:hey@aswinmohan.me">hey@aswinmohan.me</a>, if you don't
          like it, fuck off, but still hit me up at my email.
