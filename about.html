    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Aswin Mohan. I'm a Software Developer currently based out of
      Kerala, India. I love to design, code and make bold, beautiful, useful
      things. I love film photography, old typewriters and completely mechanical
      things with zero trace of electronics on the side.
    </p>
    <h2>What is this blog?</h2>
    <p>
      This blog is my corner on the Internet. I love to write, to share my
      thoughts with the world, to have great conversations with people and enjoy
      life. I'm forever grateful for the Internet to give me a seamless way to
      do that. Here I share my thoughts, my learnings and anything else I think
      about writing. This blog doesn't have any other goals than being a public
      record of my thoughts, so expect it to have a similar personality to mine.
      So if you like what I write, share your thoughts with me at
      <a href="mailto:hey@aswinmohan.me">hey@aswinmohan.me</a>, if you don't
      like it, fuck off, but still hit me up at my email.
