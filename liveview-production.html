      <h1>Phoenix LiveView in Production</h1>
      <p>
        I came across a
        <a
          href="https://elixirforum.com/t/are-you-all-in-on-liveview-how-are-you-using-it/41628/14"
          >thread on ElixirForum
        </a>
        that highlighted how everyone was using LiveView in their production
        apps. Since IndiePaper is a Phoenix LiveView app, I thought it would be
        nice to share my experience with it.
      </p>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Before we jump right in, it's better to have some context about me and
          about the project. I'm a single developer working on IndiePaper. It is
          a book publishing platform, where authors can write out their book in
          an online text editor and we typeset beautiful PDF books from it. The
          app is a simple CRUD app with auth, uploads and a custom typesetting
          engine.
        </p>

        <p>
          I used TDD to develop the app and it's deployed on
          <a href="https://fly.io">fly.io</a>.
        </p>

      <h2>Why chose LiveView?</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote the first version of IndiePaper in Phoenix, but it was at a time
        when I didn't know anything about the framework. I rewrote the entire
        app in NextJS and Hasura, then in Rails, then using FaunaDB, then in
        LiveView and finally in in vanilla Phoenix. This time around I knew
        enough Elixir and Phoenix to actually make something useful. I was
        content with the full page reloads and it was working well.
      </p>

      <p>
        After some features was complete I wanted to add file uploads for book
        promo images. Even though there were well built packages for handling
        uploads, I was intrigued by the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PffpT2eslH8"
          >File Uploads in LiveView</a
        >
        video by Chris. I tried implementing it, but it didn't work out because
        I didn't know anything about LiveView. So I bought
        <a
          href="http://pragprog.com/titles/liveview/programming-phoenix-liveview/"
          >Programming Phoenix LiveView</a
        >
        and <a href="https://www.testingliveview.com/">Testing LiveView</a> and
        started learning about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a while I finished setting up the uploads feature. Then I
        converted one more page just for the sake of it and was instantly
        hooked. I ended up converting the entire app to Phoenix LiveView,
        including a complex realtime editor. LiveView wasn't chosen, I used it,
        loved it and used it again.
      </p>
      <h2>The Great Parts</h2>
      <p>
        For any tech to be adopted widely, it should be exponentially better
        than it's predecessors and current competition (except if you're
        javascript). Phoenix LiveView is a step up from everything that has come
        until now, with great just enough abstractions and great developer
        experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Elixir Phoenix</h3>
      <p>
        Elixir and Phoenix is the best part about LiveView. Elixir is a recent
        language and hence do not have the hairy legacy that older languages. It
        has beautiful patterns, beautiful constructs and beautiful tools that
        make working with it a beautiful experience. Phoenix as a framework is
        highly performant even with small system configurations, and that sub
        10ms response time is a major factor why LiveView has a usable
        experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>
        The second best thing I loved about LiveView is testing, especially
        integration testing. I used to write integration tests with Wallaby
        which ran the tests in a headless browser. This lead to slow and flaky
        tests, even with parallel tests and error recovery. LiveView runs tests
        without instantiating a browser. It handles clicks, redirects, and form
        events. This leads to fast and stable tests.
      </p>
      <h3>SPA without SPA</h3>
      <p>
        This is the major selling point of LiveView and it holds that promise
        well. Single Page Apps with a REST or GraphQL backend requires a lot of
        extra code at the middle where the communication happens. With LiveView
        your app acts with almost the same performance and UX of a well built
        SPA without the need for API interfaces. You specify the data in the
        templates and it does the rest.
      </p>
      <h3>Javascript Hooks</h3>
      <p>
        Interop with Javascript is done through hooks. They enable you to "hook"
        into various lifecycle events of the LiveView process. Unlike other
        frameworks where escape hatches are an afterthought, hooks are well
        designed. For IndiePaper I made a text editor using TipTap and was able
        to convert the entire page from Vue to hooks with the hooks version
        being more capable and better.
      </p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>
        With the new <code>live_session</code> helper, we can bundle together
        liveviews and the navigation happens through the same websocket. This is
        insanely fast. Page navigations happen in under 100ms using from India
        with the server in US.
      </p>
      <h2>The Good Parts</h2>
      <p>
        These are the things that I liked and would never give up, even though
        these were not the reason I would switch to LiveView.
      </p>
      <h3>Form Recovery</h3>
      <p>
        Phoenix LiveView requires internet connection to function. But sometimes
        internet gets disconnected. This can be frusturating when the person is
        filling a form, because on reconnection Phoenix restores the last known
        data. If you have a <code>handle_event</code> setup with your LiveView,
        the form state gets automatically synced with the server.
      </p>
      <h3>Free Websocket</h3>
      <p>
        You get a full functional bi-driectional websocket with good
        abstractions for free. For the realtime text editor, rather than
        implementing a complex system wiht Redis and syncing, I created a json
        diff and sent the data through the websocket with
        <code>pushEvent</code> function.
      </p>
      <h2>The Bad Parts</h2>
      <p>
        Every technical choice has it's downsides, and LiveView is no exception.
      </p>
      <h3>Requires Internet Connection</h3>
      <p>
        LiveView requires an active internet connection to work properly. This
        might not be an issue for 90% of people, but if you're domain requires
        offline access, LiveView might not be a good fit. This might be a
        temporary problem as work is being done to add more offline capabilities
        to LiveView.
      </p>
      <h3>Almost Maturing Ecosystem</h3>
      <p>
        I hate to put this as a negative, but as LiveView is a young framework,
        it has not many resources to learn from for beginners. Although the
        community is small, it's really active and welcoming, so this won't be a
        problem for long.
      </p>
      <h2>The Fuck This Parts</h2>
      <p>
        Gladly nothing yet. I love Phoenix LiveView, in almost 5 months with
        LiveView I have never come across a scenario where I just put my hands
        up and thought about switching to another framework.
      </p>
      <h2>The Hopeful Parts</h2>
      <p>
        Things I wish the LiveView ecosystem would have, but doesn't or
        shouldn't.
      </p>
      <h3>Mobile</h3>
      <p>
        It would be nice to have a way to run LiveView as a native app on
        mobile. I recently made a React Native app with a Phoenix backend and I
        was put off by the amount of middleware code I had to write to get the
        data and display it. It would be great if we could write a LiveView app
        that updated a React Native based mobile app.
      </p>

      <p>
        This might sound like a hype post for LiveView, and it would be
        partially true. I loved using Phoenix LiveView for IndiePaper and If I
        had to start over again I would choose it again. It has it's
        shortcomings, sure, but it has the least shortcomings of any framework I
        have used. Try it out, you might surprise yourself.
