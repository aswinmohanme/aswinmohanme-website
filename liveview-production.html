      I came across a
      <a
        href="https://elixirforum.com/t/are-you-all-in-on-liveview-how-are-you-using-it/41628/14"
        >thread on ElixirForum
      </a>
      that highlighted how everyone was using LiveView in their production apps.
      Since IndiePaper is a Phoenix LiveView app, I thought it would be nice to
      share my experience with it.
