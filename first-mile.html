      <h1>First Mile Advantage of Frameworks and Languages</h1>
      <p>
        New frameworks and languages come out every other day. They come out
        promising the world, increased productivity, increased programmer
        happiness, less bugs and a clear cut business advantage in speed. They
        gather steam, the hype cycle starts, tutorials surface, conferences get
        set up, twitter starts raving and the framework seems to take over the
        world, only to later slide into obscurity after a while.
      </p>

        <h2>First Mile Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          Most frameworks advertise and concentrate on their first mile
          advantage. How quickly you can start writing a greenfield product out
          the door. This alone is responsible for the hype cycle. Simple things
          that used to take three days just gets done in 3 seconds. Wiff some
          generators here and there and boom you have a working app that you can
          showcase to your boss and get promoted fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is called the First Mile advantage. How quickly your framework or
          language can cover the first part of the product development. This
          might involve setting up, and seeing the first point on the screen.

        <h2>Your Project is a Marathon</h2>
        <p>
          Your project is not getting through the first mile. At the first mile
          your project is indistinguishable from the other projects. It's the
          last mile that counts and creates the difference both in your project
          and your business. When you optimize for the first mile, you start to
          give up flexibility down the road, slowing you down. You have to
          consider your project as a marathon.
        </p>
        <p>Consider the examples</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Serverless</li>
          <li>NoSQL</li>
          <li>Hosted Backends</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Consistent Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          When selecting the technologies select frameworks that give a
          consistent advantage across the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select frameworks and languages that either has been around for a long
          time so you can.
