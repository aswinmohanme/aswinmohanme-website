      <h1>First Mile vs Last Mile Advantage of Languages and Frameworks</h1>
      <p>
        New "groundbreaking" frameworks and languages come up every other day,
        promising the world and beyond. They offer increased productivity,
        increased developer happiness, less bugs with time and cost savings.
        They claim to have stumbled across these advantages due to a neat trick
        that can only be implemented by a full rewrite of a new framework. The
        framework gather steam, the hype cycle starts, tutorials surface,
        conferences get set up, twitter starts raving, and the framework seems
        to take over the world, only to later slide into obscurity and replaced
        by the next big thing.

        <h2>First Mile Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          Most frameworks advertise and concentrate on their first-mile
          advantage, the speed with which we can get a greenfield project out
          the door. Complex features that took teams weeks to implement gets
          done in days with a single developer or in minutes with magical
          generators.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is called the First Mile Advantage. How quickly your framework or
          language can cover the first leg of product development. This might be
          setting up the project, implementing common patters such as
          authentication and file-uploads or getting a single pixel on the
          screen. Since the first part of the project is the most exciting, the
          exponential progress gets far more attention than required, and the
          framework far more attribution than required even from the skeptics
          and the framework gets the green light.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a while management notices progress slowing down, owing to
          inexplicable technical issues that requires days to sort out.
          Developers wrestle with the rigidity of the framework to implement
          complex business logic which differentiates the project, throwing
          workarounds upon workarounds on top of the framework, until it turns
          into the legacy mess that everyone is secretly afraid to touch.

        <h2>Your Project is a Marathon</h2>
        <p>
          Your project is not getting through the first mile. At the first mile
          your project is indistinguishable from the other projects. Users do
          not use your product for the framework generated authentication page.
          They use it to get a complex task done faster than it would take them
          to do manually or by themselves. The definition of the project is the
          last mile, the core business logic that differentiates what your
          product does from your competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you optimize for the first mile, you pay with flexibility down
          the line down the road, slowing you down. You have to consider your
          project as a marathon. The velocity in the first-mile is irrelavant if
          you're crawing in the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should consider your product development as a marathon, which you
          will be running for 10+ years if your product turns out successful.
          The framework and language you chose will have far reaching
          consequences and can positively or negatively impact your product
          development. When choosing the framework, choose for the last-mile
          advantage.

        <h2>Last Mile Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          When selecting a framework, choose one which gives you and your team
          consistent advantages across the development cycle.
