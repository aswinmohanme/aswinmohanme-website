      <h1>Maths is an Abstraction</h1>
      <p>
        I have hated maths all through school. I used to love it, but then \(x\)
        and \(y\) got introduced and nothing was the same anymore. I never
        understood why maths was neccessary in real life, especially the ones
        about cosines and sines. I learnt enough to pass through school and
        college, but never loved the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        I rediscovered maths while casually watching
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B"

        and started to grasp the beauty of mathematics. Even though I am at a
        point in my life where the understanding of maths does not transalate to
        first order utility, I found a new love for the language. I am writing
        this so I can appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

        <h2>Maths is the Physical World on Paper</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been intrigued by one property of mathematics and
          physics, how equaations and accurately predict physical outcomes and
          how certian quantities relate so beautifully to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the famous equation \( E=mc^2 \). Everytime I used to derive
          this in school, I used to be in awe on how symbols could have meaning
          that could mesh together to get into this exact formula. We would
          start out with the formula for one dimensional motion, and after some
          derivations, integrations we would arrive at the formulat for making a
          Nuclear Bomb. Even though this was fascinating enough, I never really
          gave it any thought in school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everytime I would come across equations and numbers, mostly on
          <a href="https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary">Fermats Library</a> that
          remotely mirror this formula. I would always think how one formula
          flows effortesly onto another, how and why is so beautiful. Equations
          of motion can be dervied from one another, while making sense
          therotically.
        </p>
        <p>
          While during my zoning out in the middle of the day times I was
          thinking about numbers and really wanted to know why exactly \(2+2 =
          4\), and what is the deeper meaning of mathematics. I came to the
          conclusion that \(2+2=4\) is so because \(4=2+2\). Let me elaborate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider an apple. Now consider another apple. How many apples do we
          have now? We have \(2\) apples. So what is \(2\) then? \(2\)
          symbolically represents the amount of apples we have when we take one
          apple and another apple. Let's say we hae another \(2\) apples, so the
          total number of apples we have is \(4\). So in that respect if we take
          one apple, then another, then another, and finally another, \(4\)
          denotes the thing that we have now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maths is then an abstraction on top of the physical world. It's a way
          for us to work with symbols that can be easily manipulated
