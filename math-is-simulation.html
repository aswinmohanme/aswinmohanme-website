      <h1>Math is a Simulation of Reality</h1>
      <p>
        I have hated maths for the longest time, from school all through
        college. I loved it until \(x\) and \(y\) showed up. I never really
        understood how abstract mathematics would help me in real life, hence
        never gave any effort to the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        I rediscovered math while watching

        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B"

        and the detailed visual explanations helped me understand mathematics in
        a far deeper level that I ever could in school. Going down that path has
        helped me realise and love what mathematics really is, a simulation of
        reality.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Maths is the Physical World on Paper</h2>
        <p>
          Although I never loved math, I was intensely curious about it. Math
          had consistent properties and patterns that always intrigued me, how
          equations can accurately predict physical outcomes and how certain
          quantities relate beautifully to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the famous equation \( E=mc^2 \). When we were deriving this
          formula in school, We would start out with the formula for one
          dimensional motion, and after derivations and integration we would
          arrive at the formula for making Nuclear Bombs. Even though this was
          fascinating, I never really gave it any thought in school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everytime I came across equations and numbers
          <a href="https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary">Fermats Library</a> that
          are remotely interesting, the thought of how one mathematical symbol
          flows effortsly to another comes to mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my zoning out in the middle of the day ritual, I was thinking
          about numbers and wanted to know exactly why \(2+2 = 4\), and what is
          the deeper meaning of mathematics. I came to the conclusion that
          \(2+2=4\) is so because \(4=2+2\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider an apple. Now consider another apple. How many apples do we
          have now? We have \(2\) apples. So what is \(2\) then? \(2\)
          symbolically represents the amount of apples we have when we take one
          apple and another apple. Let's say we have another \(2\) apples, so
          the total number of apples we have is \(4\). So in that respect if we
          take one apple, then another, then another, and finally another, \(4\)
          denotes the thing that we have now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maths is then an abstraction on top of the physical world. It's a way
          for us to work with symbols that can be easily manipulated on paper as
          our primary medium. Math is then a language for representing the
          physical world. It's nothing more. But that is the sole reason why it
          reflects the physical world so beautifully. It's a language as close
          to the metal as possible. It is the shallowest usable abstraction that
          we have.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we are working with maths, we are working in a reduced set of the
          world with clearly defined rules. We are manipulating a clearly
          defined model of the physical world.
        </p>
        <p>Consider the formula.</p>
        \[ \begin{aligned} F &= ma \\ a &= \frac{v - u}{t} \\ F &=
        m(\frac{v-u}{t}) \end{aligned} \]
        <p>
          What this formula is saying is that Force \(F\) is what we get when we
          throw a mass \(m\) with an accelration \(a\). Whatever that is
          required to throw a mass with \(m\) with accelration \(a\) is denoted
          by \(F\). Accelaration \(a\) is whatever the change in final velocity
          \(v\) and initial velocity \(u\) over a period of time \(t\). So force
          \(F\) becomes the effort requried to stop a moving body in a given
          time \(t\). That is the conceptual model of force. Hence \(F\) denotes
          that quantity, which is also denoted as <code>Force</code> in the
          English language. We can then mathematically calculate that quantity
          on paper, instead of physically moving that object and measuing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the reason why we have formulas that makes sense and meshes so
          well with the real world. The real world does not obey the rules of
          mathematics, mathematics is the real world in abstraction.
        </p>

        <h2>Maths is beautiful</h2>
        <p>
          Maths hence is beautiful. Math is what asembly is to the CPU. Not
          binary but close enough to be tremendously useful. Maths makes sense,
          it's the only true language. It reduces complex physical interactions
          into easily manipulatable symbols without the chaos of the physical
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to teach students that maths is nothing more than an
          abstraction, but an abstraction that mirrors the real world in it's
          entirety. Having mastering over it, not only helps you understand it,
          but gives you a sandbox to test your theory that you can use it to
          bend reality. Maths is now very, very interesting, go I wish I knew
          this earilier.
