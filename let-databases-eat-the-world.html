           * Rather than setting up APIs that sporadically contact each other,
           why not connect database directly to the data and setup mapping, so that the data shows up in your database and you can query with SQL.

      <h1>Let us make Databases Eat the World</h1>
      <p>
        Building integrations between different services is hard. The world runs
        on a couple of different services and we are at a point in our lives
        where we can cobble together multiple APIs and create a worthwhile
        service. The problem is non standardisation of APIs. Every API is
        fundementally different. There are multiple formats to get adn share
        data, different Error handlers and webhook implementations. Rather than
        sending data to and from places. The end and start of data is databases,
        and API is just the transport mechanism.

        Rather than going through a third party, think if the databases can talk
        to each other. Let's say you have an ecommerce store and you have a list
        of stripe customer_ids that you want to query about. Rather than running
        an API call that you can query, wouldn't it be awesome if we could just
        run a join with the existing database.

      <p>This would require a centralised system like Segement where</p>
