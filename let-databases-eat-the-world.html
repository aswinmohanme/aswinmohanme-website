      <h1>Let Databases Eat the World</h1>
      <p>
        APIs are awesome. They make the modern web and by it's extension, the
        modern world tick. They enable us to build complex systems by building
        on top of existing services and infrastructure. All this seems like APIs
        are the best thing to ever happen to web development since Vim
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>APIs, the hard parts</h2>
        <p>
          Even though APIs handle a lot of complexity underneath their shiny
          interfaces and help us to punch far beyond our weight. They are still
          without their issues.
        </p>
        <h3>Integrating APIs are hard</h3>
        <p>
          Every API is different. In a perfect world APIs would only act as an
          interface without any concern of implementaiton. But in the real
          world, APIs are seldom well designed. The surface the quirks of the
          implementation and we need to work around it. Most of the issues are
          mitigated by SDKs that wrap around them, but they come with their own
          issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Integrating APIs take a non-zero amount of development time and we
          need to work on it.
        </p>
        <h3>Error handling and rate limits</h3>
        <p>
          While directly using APIs we have to take care of not hitting their
          limits. We need to specify the
        </p>
        <h3>Duplicated Efforts</h3>
        <p>
          Take Stripe. Even though every business use case is different, it's
          the same way to integrate it. The only thing that needs to change is
          the mapping between the data-model and the database.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Moving data around</h2>
        <p>
          At it's core APIs are just moving data around. They can trigger side
          effects in the world, but the start and end of that side effect is
          still data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calling an API changes the data stored in another service. There are
          no other things that you can do from that.
        </p>

        <h2>Databases to handle data</h2>
        <p>
          Since we are handling data, we can use the best tool for the job,
          Relational Databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we are using SQL to get and scale the data, we can use it to
          create and fetch more than enough for the entire system.
        </p>

        <h2>The middleware for the Internet of APIs</h2>
        <p>
          When integrating M services with N services, we can either connect
          them directly, needing MxN integrations or through a common interface
          requiring only M+n integrations. Rather than integrating the data
          between one and all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than APIs talking to each other we could have databases that
          talk to each other. We just insert the customer_id value to a column
          in Stripe table and we can have the sytem automatically fetch data
          related from the Stripe API and insert it into another database with
          the value. To then get the information about the customer we can query
          the join table.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need a single system to get the data from one database to another.
