        <h1>Superfast Webapps using NextJS, Vercel, LiveView and Fly.io</h1>
        <p>
          Making fast web apps is hard but a tremendous
          <a
            href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180724005488/en/Slow-Websites-Are-Silent-Killers-for-Businesses"
            >business oppurtunity</a
          >. It's also the right thing to do. In this blog post, I'll explain
          how <a href="https://indiepaper.me">IndiePaper</a> achieves decent
          performance with NextJS, and Phoenix hosted on Vercel and Fly.io
          respectively. Big thanks to Plausible.io for pointing out the
          <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/discussions/1593"
            >way</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Making a fast web app is complex, It requires tuning a lot of moving
          parts. The technology that you chose has a measurable impact on
          performance. We chose these technologies because they optimize for and
          care about performance.
        </p>
        <h3>NextJS</h3>
        <p>
          It's a framework based on React, geared towards static and dynamic web
          apps. It has a lot of sane defaults and can get you a halfway decent
          SPA experience out of the box. It has a couple of features like
          optimized images, preloading routes, chunked downloads and dead code
          elimination that makes the user experience insanely fast.
        </p>
        <h3>Vercel</h3>
        <p>
          They are the company behind NextJS, providing great support for
          hosting and distributing NextJS apps. They deploy your static site via
          their global CDN close to your users. With NextJS and Vercel people
          can see sub 50ms response times for your website.
        </p>
        <h3>Phoenix LiveView</h3>
        <p>
          Phoenix is the premier web framework for Elixir. It's fast, with
          microsecond response times, has an intuitive programming model and is
          the best fit for making dynamic server-side apps. LiveView takes this
          up one notch by making the data transfer over a persistent WebSocket
          connection which gives an SPA like experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Fly.io</h3>
        <p>
          Hosting static sites closer to people using CDNs is kind of easy. But
          doing the same for dynamic server-side web apps is still a hard
          problem. Fly.io streamlines running your apps close to people. It
          supports databases, work well with Phoenix, has library support for
          global databases and is comparatively cheap. Phoenix LiveView on
          Fly.io is a killer combination, and with enough regions, it's
          indistinguishable from a Single Page App.
        </p>
        <h2>Separating Static and Dynamic</h2>
        <p>
          I implemented this setup, not because of the obvious performance
          benefits, but because I wanted to separate static pages like the home
          page, privacy policy and dynamic content from the dynamic author
          dashboard. Initially, all pages including the homepage were served
          from the Phoenix app itself. This meant waste of server resources,
          pages couldn't be reliably cached, and every small grammatical change
          polluted the main application repo and needed a server restart.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was fine with this until I wanted a blog, and that too as a
          subdirectory for SEO reasons. That's when I decided to move the static
          pages to a NextJS app that can be statically generated and serve the
          remaining pages from the Phoenix app. That way we get the speed of
          static sites, and the interactivity of Phoenix LiveView.

        <h2>Domain Setup</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Point Domain Nameservers to Vercel (optional) This makes sure that
            all requests directly pass to Vercel, which improves performance.
          </li>

          <li>
            Deploy NextJS app to Root Domain on Vercel Use the root domain
            <code>https://yourdomain.com</code> for deployment, and make sure to
            redirect <code>www.yourdomain.com</code> to it.
          </li>

          <li>
            Deploy Phoenix LiveView to app subdomain on Fly.io Use fly.io and
            deploy the LiveView app to subdomain `app.yourdomain.com`. Point the
            subdomain to the fly.io IP address and generate a certificate. Make
            sure to set the <code>PHX_HOST</code> variable as the root domain
            <code>https://yourdomain.com</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Using Vercel as a Reverse Proxy</h2>
        <p>
          We want all our requests to first go to Vercel and need Vercel to
          forward all requests it cannot fulfil to our LiveView app. NextJS has
          a handy feature called
          <a
            href="https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/incremental-adoption#rewrites"
            >Rewrite Fallback</a
          >, that enable us to do just that.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a request hits our NextJS app it checks if the NextJS app has
          that route. If it has, then it fulfils that request. If there is no
          corresponding route, rather than showing a 404 page, Vercel then
          proxies the requests to our LiveView app hosted on our
          <code>app</code>
          subdomain, without changing the URL. Put this config in
          <code>next.config.js</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return {
      // After checking all Next.js pages (including dynamic routes)
      // and static files we proxy any other requests
      fallback: [
        {
          source: '/:path*',
          destination: `https://app.example.com/:path*`,
        },
      ],
    }
  }
} </pre
        >

      <section>
        <h2>Websockets and Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          If you were using vanilla Phoenix apps, this was only necessary. But
          since we are using LiveView we need some additional setup.
        </p>
        <h3>Websockets</h3>
        <p>
          By default the LiveView WebSocket will be started in
          <code>wss://yourdomain.com/live</code>. But Vercel does not support
          proxying WebSockets. We need to directly connect to our app running on
          the `app` subdomain. Put this in your <code>app.js</code> file in
          LiveView. This sets the WebSocket connection on <code>app</code> when
          deployed and localhost when running locally.
        </p>
        <pre>
const host = window.location.host;
let liveHost = "";

if (host === "yourdomain.com") {
  liveHost = "wss://app.yourdomain.com";
}

const socketHost = `${liveHost}/live`

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket(socketHost, Socket, {
...
}</pre
        >
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Phoenix stores session information in cookies, which are sent along
          with every response. Since we are using the same domain as defined by
          <code>PHX_HOST</code>, cookies are sent correctly with the HTTP
          request. But cookies are not sent with the Websocket connection
          because we are hosting it on the <code>app</code> subdomain. By
          default, cookies are not shared between subdomains. Configure cookies
          to be shared across subdomains on your <code>endpoint.ex</code> file.
        </p>
        <pre>
@session_options [
...
domain: ".yourdomain.com"
]

socket "/live", Phoenix.LiveView.Socket, websocket: [connect_info: [session: @session_options]]</pre
        >
        <p>
          Remember to put the dot. It makes sure the cookies with your session
          information is shared.
        </p>
        <h3>Check Origin</h3>
        <p>
          In <code>runtime.exs</code> file be sure to add both your domains so
          your requests are not rejected.
        </p>
        <pre>
config :your_app, YourAppWeb.Endpoint,
    url: [host: host, port: 443],
    check_origin: [
        "https://#{host}",
        "https://app.#{host}"
    ],</pre
        >

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          IndiePaper follows this architecture. You can check it out at
          <a href="https://indiepaper.me">https://indiepaper.me</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          The root domain points to a configured
          <a href="https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog"
            >https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog</a
          >
          blog hosted on Vercel. It handles all the traffic from around the
          world and serves the blog on
          <a href="https://indiepaper.me/blog">https://indiepaper.me/blog</a>. I
          can edit blog posts add and remove pages, all without touching the
          main phoenix app.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the author signs up, the author is taken to
          <a href="https://indiepaper.me/dashboard"
            >https://indiepaper.me/dashboard</a
          >. It is hosted on <code>app.indiepaper.me</code> proxied through
          Vercel. Once the author reaches the backend, LiveView takes over. No
          further HTTP requests are made as the navigation takes place through
          <a
            href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.Router.html#live_session/3"
            >live_session</a
          >. The WebSocket directly connects to Fly.io without going through
          Vercel making the app navigation smooth and fast.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seperating out your Static and Dynamic content is neccesary for SEO
          and marketing reasons. Splitting and hosting your app this way enables
          you to have a great user experience while having minimal impact on
          your developer experience. Suggestions are always welcome.
